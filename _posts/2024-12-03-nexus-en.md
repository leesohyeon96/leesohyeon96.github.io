# Nexus Usage Summary

<br/>

---

<br/>

## 🏢 Project Background

- **Environment**: **Closed network** (internal network without internet connection)

<br/>

---

<br/>

## 🔒 Issues with Closed Network Environment

- Internet is blocked, so **libraries (dependencies)** cannot be automatically downloaded from external sources
- Example: Cannot fetch **dependency packages** used by Gradle, Maven, npm, Docker, etc.

## 📦 Solution – Nexus Introduction

### ✅ What is Nexus?

- **Repository Manager** provided by Sonatype
- Acts as a **proxy** for various package managers (Maven, npm, Docker, etc.)
- By installing Nexus on internal network, libraries pre-downloaded from external network can be stored  
  and used **locally** even in closed network environments

### 🎯 Main Uses of Nexus

| Item | Description                                     |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| **Dependency Repository** | Stores libraries (e.g., jar files) pre-downloaded from external network |
| **Closed Network Support** | Enables dependency resolution in internal network                        |
| **Proxy Cache** | Once downloaded libraries are cached and reusable               |
| **Docker Registry Feature** | Can be used as **self-hosted Docker image repository**           |

We mainly used it as a Dependency repository and decided to upload required libraries individually via remote deployment

## 🐳 Nexus and Docker

- Nexus also **supports Docker Registry functionality**
- Therefore, Docker images created in-house can be stored in Nexus  
  and pull/push is possible in closed network environments
- Can also be utilized for development and deployment automation
- e.g.) Similar role to docker hub > but private

> 📝 Summary
- The target project was in a **closed network environment**, making external dependency usage impossible
- **Nexus** was used to solve this and enable dependency usage
- Nexus integrates with various package management systems like Maven/Docker  
  and serves as a **central repository** in closed network development environments
