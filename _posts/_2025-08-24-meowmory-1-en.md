# Development Motivation
- No grand reason
- 1. I wanted to create my own app
- 2. I love traveling, but when looking at photos taken during trips, I often forget when and where they were taken
     Eventually, I had to delete them due to insufficient phone storage, which I didn't like
     So I wanted to leave special memories on Google Maps
- 3. If it goes well, I'd like to make some money (confidently)

## Development Environment
- frontend : next.js(react)
  - The development environment didn't particularly need SEO, so Next.js wasn't necessary, but I had reasons for choosing it.
  - 1. I wanted to ride the trend. >> Of course, this is also a passing trend, but I thought it's good to understand it to some extent in the development industry rather than going against it.
  - 2. I wanted to use it again. >> I used Next.js for an app launch project at work, but I felt embarrassed to say I've used it, so I thought I needed to use it alone to understand it properly.
- backend : java & spring 
  - No major reason
  - 1. It's my main language, so I'm familiar with it
  - 2. Environment setup is complex (though that's old news..), but I thought it's good for building a solid foundation
- db : mysql 
  - I considered PostgreSQL, but there's no major difference and I'm more familiar with MySQL
  - I didn't think this service needed NoSQL.
    Of course, if I add features later and there's a need, I plan to introduce it.
